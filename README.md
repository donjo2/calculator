# Basic calculator
#Author: Emmanuel Joshua | @emmadonjo

I undertook this project to create a Basic Calculator as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Sorry, I had to use eval() function all through for most of the core calculations.

Nevertheless, everything worked just fine, but I feel improvements can be made. Notably, changing ++ from increment operator to addition operator (+)just as I have done with the decrement operator (--) which I changed to subtraction operator (-) for every occurrence.
