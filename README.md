# Basic calculator
#Author: Emmanuel Joshua | @emmadonjo

I undertook this project to create a Basic Calculator as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. The experience has been wonderful. Had to learn CSS Grid and Flexbox, changing theme using CSS constants, etc.

Sorry, I had to use eval() function all through for most of the core calculations. I learnt "eval() is evil", but had to rely on it for the core functionality.

Nevertheless, everything worked just fine, but I feel improvements can be made. Notably, changing ++ from increment operator to addition operator (+) just as I have done with the decrement operator (--) which I changed to subtraction operator (-) for every occurrence.

Contributions are welcomed!
